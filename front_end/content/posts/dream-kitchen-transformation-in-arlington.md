## Project Overview

This kitchen remodel brought a complete transformation to a family home in Arlington. The homeowners wanted a space that balanced modern elegance with everyday practicality. Their wishlist included open shelving for ease of access, durable quartz countertops, and a spacious center island to entertain guests while cooking.

We worked closely with the family to create a design that fit their lifestyle and aesthetic goals. The final result was a bright, open, and inviting kitchen that quickly became the heart of their home.

## Design Goals

- **Open Shelving**: Replaced upper cabinets with custom-built open shelves made from white oak. These allow easy access to everyday dishes and add warmth to the clean design.
- **Quartz Countertops**: We used pure white quartz to reflect light and make the space feel larger. Its durability ensures it will look great for years to come.
- **Functional Island**: The center island features a waterfall quartz edge, built-in storage, and under-counter lighting. It comfortably seats four, perfect for both casual meals and entertaining.

## Materials Used

- **Countertops**: Caesarstone Quartz – Pure White
- **Cabinetry**: Custom-built, soft-close shaker style with matte black hardware
- **Flooring**: Engineered European white oak
- **Backsplash**: Hand-glazed ceramic tiles in a soft gray hue
- **Appliances**: Stainless steel, energy-efficient models from Bosch and Samsung

## Challenges & Solutions

During demolition, we discovered outdated plumbing that needed to be replaced. Although this added time to the schedule, it gave us a chance to upgrade the system and ensure long-term safety and performance. We also reworked the layout to improve workflow between the sink, stove, and fridge—the classic kitchen triangle.

## Final Thoughts

This Arlington kitchen remodel is a perfect example of how thoughtful design and quality materials can breathe new life into an older space. From cozy family breakfasts to lively dinner parties, this kitchen now supports every aspect of the family’s life.
