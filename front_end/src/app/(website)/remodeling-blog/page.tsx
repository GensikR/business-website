//   challenge: 'Cramped, outdated, and inefficient.',
//   challenge_summary: 'The client’s kitchen hadn’t been updated since the early 2000s, and lacked both style and space efficiency.',
//   challenge_content: `
//     The homeowners were tired of their dark, dated cabinets and cluttered countertops. 
//     Storage was limited, lighting was poor, and the layout didn’t allow multiple people to cook together comfortably. 
//     It felt disconnected from the rest of the home and didn’t reflect the family’s modern lifestyle.
//   `,
//   solution: 'Bright, open, and fully custom.',
//   solution_summary: 'We reimagined the layout with a focus on natural light, clean design, and functional upgrades.',
//   solution_content: `
//     We knocked down the wall between the kitchen and dining room to open the space. 
//     Custom white oak cabinetry, quartz countertops, and a waterfall island brought a high-end feel. 
//     Integrated lighting and hidden appliances created a seamless and calming look, while adding much-needed storage.
//   `,
//   conclusion_title: 'From Frustration to Function',
//   conclusion_content: `
//     The result was a stunning transformation that turned the kitchen into the heart of the home. 
//     The family now enjoys cooking together, entertaining guests, and spending quality time in their new favorite space.
